/**
 * Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:
 *
 * Begin with an empty string s.
 * For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:
 * If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
 * Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
 * Return a compressed string.
 * The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead be stored in the input
 * character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.
 *
 * After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.
 *
 *
 * Follow up:
 * Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?
